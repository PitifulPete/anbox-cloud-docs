* You can now configure the [CORS settings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) for those API endpoints that the appliance reverse proxy passes to the Anbox Stream Gateway. You can set the following using the `anbox-cloud-appliance config set` command:<!--AC-2732-->
  - The network's public IP address (`network.public_address`)
